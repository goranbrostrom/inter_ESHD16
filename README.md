# Clustering and intergenerational transfers of infant mortality in 19th
century northern Sweden


## The report on infant mortality for the ESHD 2016 Conference

*toIDS.Rmd* is an *R markdown* file; the corresponding *html* file is 
*toIDS.html*. Creates IDS files from DDB files (sort of "reverse
engineering": The DDB files were in 'analysis' format).

*fromIDS.Rmd* is an *R markdown* file; the corresponding *html* file is 
*fromIDS.html*. Creates files for statistical analysis from IDS files
(INDIVIDUAL and INDIV_INDIV, particularly simple versions). And
documentation *on the fly*. 

## General

Install **R** and *RStudio* and run the Rmarkdown files. You need data (IDS),
which is *not* included here. *RStudio* will guide you in installing the
necessary add-on packages.

You can choose as output media from *html*, *pdf* and *word*.

## Download

For opening an html document, choose "Download ZIP",
unpack the zip file and open the html document in a web browser. 

Better still, install [git](https://git-scm.com) and *clone* the repository
and *contribute*. Contact me if you are serious about it.
