```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Data from scratch

First we read data, from IDS and from the created data file.
```{r readin}
load("ef.rda")
source("R/read_IDS.R")
individual <- read_IDS()
```

Then we check the amount of information for each individual in IDS, present in *ef*.
```{r checkin}
id <- unique(ef$Id_I)
indiv <- individual[individual$Id_I %in% id, ]
xx <- with(indiv, tapply(Id_I, Id_I, length))
table(xx)
```
